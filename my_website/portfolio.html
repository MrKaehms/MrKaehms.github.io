	simple piano scratch project and extended it to record a single 
	song. We wanted to go further and have it save complete songs, but ran into a Scratch limitation trying to deal with lists of lists</td></tr>

We will use this prototype later, to complete in Python</td></tr>

	In this assignment, Emily and I turned our mutual interest in the outdoors into an interactive story using Python to manage branching within the story.
	Built from a process from story board to flowchart to Python code, this is a good introductory assignment to work though some of the basic features of Python.	</td></tr>

		image (top) or output image (bottom)to see the image at full scale. Unfortunately in this revision I was unable to save the image at the same resolution as the original image.<P>The source code also contains a pixelate function that has been tested, but was not applied to this image.</td></tr>

In this example remix of a virus simulation that is included with Netlogo, Rob and I added additional parameters to identify a certain percent of the population that was vaxinated at birth, and some support code.  We modified the simulation assumptions as follows:<P>
	<b>Assumption</b>: You vax child at birth<br>
   <b>Key params:</b> Moved infectiousness to 90%, chanceofrecover to 50%<br>
   Set %vaxed to 10%<br>
Added in code that recovered person only stay immune for 12 weeks (immunityduration). This was originally long. This param only those that got sick.
